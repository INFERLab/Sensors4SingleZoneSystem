# Sensors4SingleZoneSystems

This repository contains the code and data used for our analysis of the role of remote sensors for comfort, energy, and demand response in single-zone multi-node systems. 

We are not able to publish the ecobee dataset of 1,000 houses mentioned in the analysis. However, the dataset is publicly available at https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1854924
 
Two publications have utilized this code in their analysis.
